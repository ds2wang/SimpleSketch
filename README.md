SimpleSketch
============
This is a simple sketch application that has the basic functionalities of paint. With the exception of the animation features of the application, all of the code was completed from the summer 2010 to first year University (Proof can be provided if needed). The animation aspect was done as part of a school project. Since it is still one of my earlier samples of code, I have since learned a lot more about producing better code.
